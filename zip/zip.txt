zip function in Python:-

The zip() function in Python is used to combine elements from multiple iterable objects (
such as lists, tuples, or strings) into tuples. It returns an iterator of tuples, where each 
tuple contains elements from the input iterables at the corresponding positions.

zip(iterable1, iterable2, ...)

Syntax:-

zipped = zip(list1, list2, list3)
result = list(zipped)
print(result)
