Enumerate in python:-

In Python, enumerate() is a built-in function that returns an enumerate object, 
which yields pairs of elements along with their indices. 

It's commonly used in loops to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) 
while keeping track of the index of each element.

It is simply used to keep track of the iteration.
