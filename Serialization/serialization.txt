Serialization in python:-
Serialization of Python Objects
	Serialization is the process of converting a Python object (like a dictionary, list, or class instance) into a format 
	that can be stored, transmitted, or shared. The most common formats for serialization are JSON, Pickle, and XML.
	
Why is Serialization Needed?
	Save Python objects to files (Persistence)
		Example: Save user settings, cache data, logs.
	Send data over networks
		Example: APIs, Kafka messages, WebSockets.
	Inter-process communication
		Example: Share data between different Python programs.
	Database storage
		Example: Store Python objects in databases like MongoDB or Redis.
		

Serialization with JSON (Most Common)
The json module in Python is widely used for serialization because JSON is: 
✅ Human-readable
✅ Supported by most programming languages
✅ Ideal for web applications and APIs
